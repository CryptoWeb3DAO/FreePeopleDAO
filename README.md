The ConstitutionDAO was a decentralized self-government organization, formed by Alice Ma et al., and used to raise Ethereum to bid for a copy of the United States Constitution, auctioned by Sotheby's. The copy is the only copy still owned by private collectors, and the proceeds from the auction go to a charity established by the current owner.

An initial crowdfunding target of $20 million to issue PEOPLE tokens to donors in a 1 E T H = 1 million PEOPLE ratio, PEOPLE token holders will be entitled to vote on constitutional copy use, but will not grant any actual ownership. The news of the bidding sparked a frenzy in the crypto community, with ConstitutionDAO raising more than $40 million, or 200% of the crowdfunding quota, in less than a week, starting from November 12 to November 18,2021. If you win the auction, ConstitutionDAO Planning works with famous museums or historical societies to display the stall in free public places.
